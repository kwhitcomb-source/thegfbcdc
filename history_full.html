<div class="timeline"><div class="timeline-item"><div class="timeline-marker"><div class="timeline-icon"><i class="fas fa-church"></i></div></div><div class="timeline-content"><span class="timeline-date">1876</span><h3>The Beginning</h3><p>In the year of 1876, a few of the emancipated slaves, feeling the need of religious guidance, met in the home of sister Charlotte Hamilton, Sherman Avenue, north of Kenyon Street, Mount Pleasant Plains, and started a song and prayer class.</p></div></div><div class="timeline-item"><div class="timeline-marker"><div class="timeline-icon"><i class="fas fa-home"></i></div></div><div class="timeline-content"><span class="timeline-date">1877</span><h3>First Baptist Church, Mount Pleasant Plains</h3><p>They built a frame mission on the corner of Sherman Avenue and Kenyon Street. This mission was given the name of the "First Baptist Church, Mount Pleasant Plains" in 1878. Rev. Andrew Green as pastor and founder laid the foundation for what would become a thriving congregation.</p></div></div><div class="timeline-item"><div class="timeline-marker"><div class="timeline-icon"><i class="fas fa-star"></i></div></div><div class="timeline-content"><span class="timeline-date">1882</span><h3>Rev. Augustus Watts</h3><p>Rev. Green served as pastor for four years and passed from labor to his reward in 1882. Rev. Augustus Watts served as pastor for seven years and resigned. Rev. Anderson Richardson served two years before being called to the great beyond.</p></div></div><div class="timeline-item"><div class="timeline-marker"><div class="timeline-icon"><i class="fas fa-star"></i></div></div><div class="timeline-content"><span class="timeline-date">1890</span><h3>Expansion &amp; New Property</h3><p>During Rev. George McGoins' pastorage, two lots on the southeast corner of Lamont Street and Sherman Avenue were purchased. Rev. John Morton of Atchison, Kansas was elected pastor and after a short stay resigned. Rev. Samuel Taylor served as pastor only a few years, and in 1896 left the church financially and numerically weak with a foreclosure mortgage of $500.00 on the property.</p></div></div><div class="timeline-item"><div class="timeline-marker"><div class="timeline-icon"><i class="fas fa-star"></i></div></div><div class="timeline-content"><span class="timeline-date">1896</span><h3>Faith &amp; Perseverance</h3><p>The trustees tried every effort to obtain the money, but it was the sisters of the church who took upon themselves the task to procure the amount to save the church. Through the pleading of sister Betty Barnes, Mr. Cook and his sister loaned the church $5500.00 on September 25, 1896.</p></div></div><div class="timeline-item"><div class="timeline-marker"><div class="timeline-icon"><i class="fas fa-star"></i></div></div><div class="timeline-content"><span class="timeline-date">1897</span><h3>Rev. Morton Recalled</h3><p>Rev. Morton was recalled as pastor. Through many struggles the mortgage of $500.00 was paid off in 1902. By this time the frame building had weakened and a permit to repair or rebuild another building was denied.</p></div></div><div class="timeline-item"><div class="timeline-marker"><div class="timeline-icon"><i class="fas fa-star"></i></div></div><div class="timeline-content"><span class="timeline-date">1905</span><h3>Transition Period</h3><p>Rev. Morton resigned in 1905. The prayers of these saints were answered in April 1910 when the Rev. Daniel Washington of King George, Virginia, was called as pastor. The old frame building was torn down and services were held in a tent on Kenyon Street until the brick church building was completed.</p></div></div><div class="timeline-item"><div class="timeline-marker"><div class="timeline-icon"><i class="fas fa-landmark"></i></div></div><div class="timeline-content"><span class="timeline-date">December 1911</span><h3>Our Home Since 1876</h3><p>The brick church building was completed in December 1911. It was a great problem to pay off this mortgage and a struggle for years to pay the interest which was very high. Lord and good leadership in the person of Dr. Washington, in 1918, the sisters of the church sponsored a program which netted $1300.00; the interest was paid and $1000.00 was paid on the principal.</p></div></div><div class="timeline-item"><div class="timeline-marker"><div class="timeline-icon"><i class="fas fa-coins"></i></div></div><div class="timeline-content"><span class="timeline-date">1918-1923</span><h3>Mortgage Paid in Full</h3><p>The members then worked untiringly to pay the mortgage. In 1923, First Baptist Church, Mount Pleasant Plains was free from all debts and obtained a clear title to their property. Dr. Daniel Washington served for thirty-three years. The church retired him in 1939 and has since gone to receive his glorious reward.</p></div></div><div class="timeline-item"><div class="timeline-marker"><div class="timeline-icon"><i class="fas fa-star"></i></div></div><div class="timeline-content"><span class="timeline-date">1940</span><h3>Rev.
