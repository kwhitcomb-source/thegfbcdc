                <p>
                  In the year of 1876, a few of the emancipated slaves, feeling the need of religious guidance, met in the home of sister Charlotte Hamilton, Sherman Avenue, north of Kenyon Street, Mt. Pleasant Plains, and started a song and prayer class.

                <p>
                  They built a frame mission on the corner of Sherman Avenue and Kenyon Street. This mission was given the name of the "First Baptist Church, Mt. Pleasant Plains" in 1878. Rev. Andrew Green as pastor and founder laid the foundation for what would become a thriving congregation.

                <p>
                  During Rev. George McGoins' pastorage, two lots on the southeast corner of Lamont Street and Sherman Avenue were purchased. Rev. John Morton of Atchison, Kansas was elected pastor and after a short stay resigned. Rev. Samuel Taylor served as pastor only a few years, and in 1896 left the church financially and numerically weak with a foreclosure mortgage of $500.00 on the property.

                <p>
                  The trustees tried every effort to obtain the money, but it was the sisters of the church who took upon themselves the task to procure the amount to save the church. Through the pleading of sister Betty Barnes, Mr. Cook and his sister loaned the church $5500.00 on September 25, 1896.

                  Rev. Morton was recalled as pastor. Through many struggles the mortgage of $500.00 was paid off in 1902. By this time the frame building had weakened and a permit to repair or rebuild another building was denied.

                  Rev. Morton resigned in 1905. The prayers of these saints were answered in April 1910 when the Rev. Daniel Washington of King George, Virginia, was called as pastor. The old frame building was torn down and services were held in a tent on Kenyon Street until the brick church building was completed.

                <p>
                  The brick church building was completed in December 1911. It was a great problem to pay off this mortgage and a struggle for years to pay the interest which was very high. Lord and good leadership in the person of Dr. Washington, in 1918, the sisters of the church sponsored a program which netted $1300.00; the interest was paid and $1000.00 was paid on the principal.

                <h3>Mortgage Paid in Full</h3>
                <p>
                  The members then worked untiringly to pay the mortgage. In 1923, First Baptist Church, Mt. Pleasant Plains was free from all debts and obtained a clear title to their property. Dr. Daniel Washington served for thirty-three years. The church retired him in 1939 and has since gone to receive his glorious reward.
