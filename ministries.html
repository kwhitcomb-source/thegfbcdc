                    <p>Prayer cannot be overestimated. Our Church is a body of believers dependent upon prayer, and committed to God. Each Sunday, during the morning service, a team of volunteers is praying for the ministry of the Word. Throughout the week, volunteers from our Prayer Warriors team pray for their pastor, a list of church members, any special requests, and missionary prayer needs. Each Wednesday, the church comes together for a special time of prayer and Bible study.</p>

                    <p>Marriages can be difficult to maintain. Several couples at our church serve other families as marriage counselors. Their role in listening, understanding, helping, and encouraging struggling couples has, by God’s grace, saved marriages, and repaired relationships. Couples have found fresh hope and new joy in a warm and fulfilling relationships.</p>
