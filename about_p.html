                    <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #2c5aa0; padding-left: 1.5rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; font-style: italic; color: #1e3a5f;">
                        "My philosophy of ministry is to connect to others through Love. My preaching, teaching and leadership style reflect my commitment to the mission to model Christian love in every area of life; to create a relational and missional culture of family that is revealed and duplicated through congregational fellowship and holistic small groups that use prayer, scripture, evangelism, worship, and Christ-centered transformational leadership to carry out the great Commission of winning souls and making disciples."
